      <p>
        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) apply when you use SubUp, the mobile app
        operated by {site.company} (“Inteck”, “we”, “us”) for organising private
        recreational sports groups in the United Kingdom.
      </p>
      <p>
        {site.company} is a company registered in England and Wales (company number{" "}
        {site.companyNumber}). Registered office: {site.address}
      </p>

      <h3>1. Eligibility and your account</h3>
      <p>
        You must be able to enter a contract under UK law. There is no age gate in this
        version of the app. You are responsible for the accuracy of the information you
        provide, including your UK mobile number, and for keeping your login details
        secure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sign-up and login use a UK mobile number and password. Email is optional and
        is not used to log in. You can delete your account in Settings at any time.
      </p>

      <h3>2. What SubUp is for</h3>
      <p>
        SubUp is for organising private groups, scheduling games, joining or leaving a
        lobby, paying to play, recording scores, voting for Man of the Match, and
        viewing history and ratings. Groups are invite-only.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not run the sport, hire the pitch, or supervise games. Group admins
        organise sessions. You agree to treat other players with respect and not to
        misuse invites, notifications, or SMS.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Payments, fees, and refunds</h3>
      <p>
        Paid games are joined with Apple Pay, Google Pay, or card via Stripe. You pay
        the pitch cost the organiser set plus a SubUp service fee shown before you
        confirm. The fee is currently 10% of the pitch cost, with a minimum of 50p.
        Free (£0) games have no SubUp fee and skip Stripe.
      </p>
      <p>
        The organiser (the group treasurer) receives the pitch amount through Stripe
        Connect. SubUp retains the service fee. There is no cash or waived entry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each group sets a lock window of 24, 48, or 72 hours before kickoff. If you
        leave before that window, the pitch is refunded; the SubUp service fee is not.
        After the lock window you cannot leave a confirmed spot.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a game is cancelled before kickoff — including automatic cancellation when
        too few paid players have joined — the pitch is refunded and the SubUp service
        fee is not. After kickoff the game cannot be cancelled and payments are not
        refunded.
      </p>
      <p>
        The treasurer is paid the pitch total after the game starts; that usually
        reaches their bank in around two business days. SubUp retains the service fee
        when you pay. Stripe’s terms also apply to card payments and organiser
        payouts. We do not store full card or bank account numbers.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Scores, votes, and ratings</h3>
      <p>
        After a game, an admin can enter the score. Players may vote for Man of the
        Match. Ratings (MMR) update from results. These are for fun within private
        groups. We do not guarantee they are complete or accurate.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Acceptable use</h3>
      <p>
        We may suspend or delete accounts that abuse the service — for example spam
        invites, impersonation, harassment, or attempts to access other people’s data.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Ending your account</h3>
      <p>
        You can delete your account in Settings. We remove your memberships, upcoming
        spots, tokens, and login. Past game history may show “Deleted user”. If you
        are the last admin of a group that still has members, promote someone else
        first. Groups where you are the only member are deleted with your account.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Changes</h3>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms. If we change the version stored in the app, you
        will be asked to accept again before continuing.
      </p>

      <h3>8. Availability and liability</h3>
      <p>
        SubUp is provided as-is. We do not guarantee that every game will go ahead,
        that scores or ratings are complete, or that the service will be uninterrupted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing in these Terms limits your statutory rights as a consumer under UK
        law, or our liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, or
        for fraud. To the extent permitted by UK law we are not liable for lost games,
        venue issues, other players’ conduct, payment processor outages, or indirect
        loss.
      </p>

      <h3>9. Governing law</h3>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. The courts of
        England and Wales have exclusive jurisdiction, without affecting any consumer
        right you have to bring a claim in your UK home court.
